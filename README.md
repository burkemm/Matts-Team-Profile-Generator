**What's the result of my work for this app?** <BR />
I'm able to generate an output HTML file with all my team assignments. It queries the user for the team member's name, email, id, and github account for an engineer. 
queries the user for name, id, email, and name of school for interns. This is a great app for keeping up with my team members. I can also add team members if I want.

**What did I learn from this assignment?** <BR />
I learned about npm tests and how to set them as requirements. They're very useful if a management team wants a dev team to meet certain requirements on an app in 
development. I also learned how to set up a user query that asks them info they would like to input. I learned about how to generate output files based on a template.
I learned how to set classes and export them to be extended in other classes. I also learned how constructors work.
